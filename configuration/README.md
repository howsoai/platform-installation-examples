# Howso Platform Configuration Guide

This section covers various configuration options for the Howso Platform. Similar to the [installation guides](../README.md#documentation-approach), the approach taken is to provide self-contained guides setting up a local Howso Platform deployment.


## Contents

- [Ingress Configuration](ingress/README.md)
- [Authentication and Single Sign-On](../oidc/README.md)
- [Domain Customization](ingress/domain-customization/README.md)
- [Security Considerations](../security/README.md)

Full configuration options are available in the Helm chart values.  For more information, see:
